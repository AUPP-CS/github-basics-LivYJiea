Liv Yong Jiea , Im eager to learn and gain more experience this semester, Heres a poem i wrote along time ago  
"Eternal Midnight"
For mornings when i can't see you
spice mint tea...
to warm the day

For brunch a lemon marmallade muffin
bitter and sweet to fit the mood...

For lunch a cup of black coffee and 
stale crackers for a boring bitter time 

For dinner the eternal mignight 
blue, the stars and the dark night sky
for when iam without you
 ...how lonely it is without you
